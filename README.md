# UWdepartures

**UWdepartures** is a realtime, live transit departure board for the University of Waterloo Terminal. This can be put on any display to turn it into a departure board, so that students and other folks that use the terminal don't miss their:
* **ION Light Rail** Trains
* Local **GRT** Buses
* Intercity **GO Transit** Buses

Inspired by the recent redesign of departure boards at Toronto Union Station, this departure board matches the Metrolinx style exactly and will direct travellers to the correct platform â€” a feature not yet available on any other app.
