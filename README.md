# UWdepartures

**UWdepartures** is a realtime, live transit departure board for the University of Waterloo Terminal. This can be put on any display to turn it into a departure board, so that students and other folks that use the terminal don't miss their bus or ION train.

Inspired by the recent redesign of departure boards at Toronto Union Station, this departure board matches the Metrolinx style exactly and will direct travellers to the correct platform â€” a feature not yet available on any other app.
